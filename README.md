# Peachpuff (Vim Port)


A bright, elegant, and nostalgic **color theme for Visual Studio Code**,
faithfully ported from the classic **Vim “Peachpuff”** scheme — originally authored by *David Nečas (Yeti)* and later maintained within Vim’s runtime.
Perfect for users who enjoy a soft light background with warm contrast and a vintage charm.
